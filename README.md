# GOF-Design-Patterns

## Creational
### Factory Method
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Structural

### Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.


### Bridge
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### Composite
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

### Decorator
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
